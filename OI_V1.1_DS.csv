The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.4 and 15.0 through 15.6 and IOS XE 2.2 through 3.17 contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated remote attacker to remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP: Versions 1 2c and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier the attacker must know the SNMP readonly community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3 the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. All devices that have enabled SNMP and have not explicitly excluded the affected MIBs or OIDs should be considered vulnerable.

An issue was discovered on Orbic Wonder Orbic RC555L RC555L:7.1.2 N2G47H 329100b:user releasekeys devices allowing attackers to obtain sensitive information (such as textmessage content) by reading a copy of the Android log on the SD card. The systemwide Android logs are not directly available to thirdparty apps since they tend to contain sensitive data. Thirdparty apps can read from the log but only the log messages that the app itself has written. Certain apps can leak data to the Android log due to not sanitizing log messages which is in an insecure programming practice. Preinstalled system apps and apps that are signed with the framework key can read from the systemwide Android log. We found a preinstalled app on the Orbic Wonder that when started via an Intent will write the Android log to the SD card also known as external storage via com.ckt.mmitest.MmiMainActivity. Any app that requests the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can read from the SD card. Therefore a local app on the device can quickly start a specific component in the preinstalled system app to have the Android log written to the SD card. Therefore any app colocated on the device with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can obtain the data contained within the Android log and continually monitor it and mine the log for relevant data. In addition the default messaging app (com.android.mms) writes the body of sent and received text messages to the Android log as well as the recipient phone number for sent text messages and the sending phone number for received text messages. In addition any call data contains phone numbers for sent and received calls. ,Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an error state mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake() SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()) however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read() SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted encrypted directly from the SSL TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read() SSL_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected. ,Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges. The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: (1) the failure to restrict the use of CMPspecific Telnet options only to internal local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device; and (2) the incorrect processing of malformed CMPspecific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMPspecific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.

On Hyundai Pay Kasse HK1000 devices a side channel for the rowbased OLED display was found. The power consumption of each rowbased display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN and BIP39 mnemonic. In other words the side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device's USB connection to make powerconsumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data. ,Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 are vulnerable to a stackbased buffer overflow. The function creating an outgoing NTLM type3 header (`lib vauth ntlm.c:Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message()`) generates the request HTTP header contents based on previously received data. The check that exists to prevent the local buffer from getting overflowed is implemented wrongly (using unsigned math) and as such it does not prevent the overflow from happening. This output data can grow larger than the local buffer if very large 'nt response' data is extracted from a previous NTLMv2 header provided by the malicious or broken HTTP server. Such a 'large value' needs to be around 1000 bytes or more. The actual payload data copied to the target buffer comes from the NTLMv2 type2 response header. ,Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

An issue was discovered in apply.cgi on DLink DAP1520 devices before 1.10b04Beta02. Whenever a user performs a login action from the web interface the request values are being forwarded to the ssi binary. On the login page the web interface restricts the password input field to a fixed length of 15 characters. The problem is that validation is being done on the client side hence it can be bypassed. When an attacker manages to intercept the login request (POST based) and tampers with the vulnerable parameter (log_pass) to a larger length the request will be forwarded to the webserver. This results in a stackbased buffer overflow. A few other POST variables (transferred as part of the login request) are also vulnerable: html_response_page and log_user. ,Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

In NETGEAR Nighthawk X10R9000 prior to 1.0.4.26 an attacker may execute arbitrary system commands as root by sending a speciallycrafted MAC address to the NETGEAR Genie SOAP endpoint at AdvancedQoS:GetCurrentBandwidthByMAC. Although this requires QoS being enabled advanced QoS being enabled and a valid authentication JWT additional vulnerabilities (CVE201912510) allow an attacker to interact with the entire SOAP API without authentication. Additionally DNS rebinding techniques may be used to exploit this vulnerability remotely. Exploiting this vulnerability is somewhat involved. The following limitations apply to the payload and must be overcome for successful exploitation:No more than 17 characters may be used.At least one colon must be included to prevent mangling.A singlequote and metacharacter must be used to break out of the existing command.Parent command remnants after the injection point must be dealt with.The payload must be in allcaps. Despite these limitations it is still possible to gain access to an interactive root shell via this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP: Versions 1 2c and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier the attacker must know the SNMP readonly community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3 the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. All devices that have enabled SNMP and have not explicitly excluded the affected MIBs or OIDs should be considered vulnerable.

curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the NTLM authentication code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow. (This bug is almost identical to CVE20178816.) ,Incorrect Calculation

After the session is created it is possible to call authenticated CGI modules by sending the cookie username=admin in the HTTP request. The invoked CGI will check if a valid session is present and bound to the user's IP address.) It was found that it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to create a valid session without a login. The network_mgr.cgi CGI module contains a command called cgi_get_ipv6 that starts an admin sessiontied to the IP address of the user making the requestif the additional parameter flag with the value 1 is provided.

The MXQ TV Box 4.4.2 Android device with a build fingerprint of MBX m201_N m201_N:4.4.2 KOT49H 20160106:user testkeys contains the Android framework with a package name of android (versionCode=19 versionName=4.4.220170213) that dynamically registers a broadcast receiver app component named com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver instead of statically registering it in the AndroidManifest.xml file of the core Android package as done in Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code for Android 4.4.2. The dynamicregistration of the MasterClearReceiver broadcast receiver app component is not protected with the android.permission.MASTER_CLEAR permission during registration so any app colocated on the device even those without any permissions can programmatically initiate a factory reset of the device. A factory reset will remove all user data and apps from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that have not been backed up or synced externally. The capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to thirdparty apps (those that the user installs themselves with the exception of enabled Mobile Device Management (MDM) apps) although this capability can be obtained by leveraging an unprotected app component of core Android process. ,Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
